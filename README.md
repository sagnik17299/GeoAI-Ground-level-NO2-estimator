This is an XGBoost regression based ML model to estimate Ground Level NO2 prediction in Italy.This is a problem that appeared in a data science competition on Zindi.This problem was contributed by Italy.The solution code is yet to be more optimised. I performed basic xgboost hyperparameter tuning using Optuna distribution module.This solution helped me to get a rank of 39 out of 270 people.
